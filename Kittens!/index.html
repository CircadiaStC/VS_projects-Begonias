            from The Kitten and Falling Leaves<br>
             William Wordsworth - 1770-1850<br>
             <br>
See the kitten on the wall, sporting with the leaves that fall,<br>
Withered leaves—one—two—and three, from the lofty elder-tree!<br>
Through the calm and frosty air, of this morning bright and fair . . .<br>
—But the kitten, how she starts; Crouches, stretches, paws, and darts!<br>
            <br>
First at one, and then its fellow, just as light and just as yellow;<br>
There are many now—now one—now they stop and there are none;<br>
What intenseness of desire, in her upward eye of fire!<br>
            <br>
With a tiger-leap half way, now she meets the coming prey,<br>
Lets it go as fast, and then, has it in her power again:<br>
Now she works with three or four, like an Indian Conjuror;<br>
Quick as he in feats of art, far beyond in joy of heart.<br>
            <br>
        </p>
